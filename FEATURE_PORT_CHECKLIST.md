# Fresh Start — Feature Port Checklist

**Source of truth for what to port from the parent Biomechanics Sandbox.**

Implementation is Fresh Start–native (rewrite). Parent physics code, tuning, notes, and history must **never** be copied or used as physics guidance.

## How to mark


| Mark    | Meaning                                 |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `- [x]` | Want / port (or already implemented)    |
| `- [ ]` | Keep for later — stays on the checklist |
| `- [O]` | Ignore forever — removed on prune       |


1. Edit marks as above.
2. Optionally note constraints under an item.
3. Tell the agent to refresh `[FEATURE_PORT_BACKLOG.md](./FEATURE_PORT_BACKLOG.md)` and/or **prune** `[O]` **items**.
4. Only `[x]` items enter the implementation backlog.

**Decisions locked in**

- Physics: Rapier-native extensions when needed; never port parent soft-body solver/tuning.
- Learning: keep Fresh Start MLP + GA; do **not** port parent NEAT.
- Section B layout: defer UI chrome until the feature that needs it lands (see B note).

**Updated:** 2026-08-06 — D16 training telemetry log; D9–D15 training experimentation (dock IA, recipes, warm starts, schedules, priorities, new experiences, shareable packs).

### Clarifications resolved


| ID                               | Question               | Answer                                                                                                                                 | Mark                         |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **A8** Gait fingerprints         | What is this?          | Parent debug viz: a scrolling “barcode” of which contacts were planted over time (gait timeline). Not required for training.           | Removed (`[O]`)              |
| **C1.1** Mark feet               | Only if goals benefit? | Yes — Fresh Start run/jump already treat all joints as feet; explicit foot marks improve lift/landing scoring.                         | `[x]`                        |
| **D3** Progressive limits        | What is this?          | After a clear, auto-raise course difficulty (taller tower, wider gap, rougher terrain). Useful later for climb / E6.8.                 | `[ ]` defer                  |
| **D6** Multi-brain phase handoff | What is this?          | Sequence brains by stage (e.g. run-up → deploy → glide). **Not needed** — G10 uses structural aero parts + single MLP/muscles.         | `[ ]` defer                  |
| **D7** Expanded observations     | Needed?                | Contact / terrain packs shipped. Optional **raycast whiskers** (Train toggle) for obstacle foresight; object-ID sensors still skipped. | `[x]` (+ optional raycasts)  |
| **E6 expand**                    | Which parent goals?    | Port all realistic skill goals that fit Rapier + existing world features. Skip object/sports/ice/gimmick/retired (see E6 ignore list). | `[x]`                        |
| **E5 count**                     | How many secrets?      | Target **100** discoverable secrets (parent had 90; FS currently 10).                                                                  | `[x]`                        |
| **Brand**                        | Rename / tagline?      | **Solemn Sandbox** — *A serious environment to carry out silly experiments.*                                                           | `[x]` B19                    |
